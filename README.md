# 🌟 KMUT Appeal Status Checker 🌟

Welcome to the **KMUT Appeal Status Checker** project!

This Python script is designed to automate the process of checking the status of an appeal on the KMUT (Kalaingar Magalir Urimai Thogai) portal. It leverages the `requests` library to interact with the portal, demonstrating practical web automation techniques and enhancing understanding of web security and cybersecurity concepts.

## 🚀 Project Details

The KMUT Appeal Status Checker project automates the process of checking the status of an appeal on the KMUT portal. It does so by sending an HTTP POST request to the portal's API endpoint. The script provides an educational resource for web automation enthusiasts and those interested in cybersecurity concepts.
